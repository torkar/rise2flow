# Rise 2 Flow replication package

In `docs/` one can find the R Markdown file (`index.Rmd`) which, when executed in `RStudio` compiles to `index.html`, which can be viewed [online](https://torkar.github.io/rise2flow/).

In `data/` all data for the analysis can be found in `csv` format. The data are divided into three files: `daily.csv` (responses from the daily survey), `weekly.csv` (responses from the weekly survey), and `cleanedData.csv` (responses for the instruments used when people enter and exit the survey).

In `data/plots/` you can also find a figure we used in the manuscript and some `R` code for generating various figures.

A good start would be to clone the directory and open the project in `RStudio` by clicking `rise2flow.Rproj`, but if you don't feel like running everything (it takes a few hours) then please feel free to simply look at the replication package [here](https://torkar.github.io/rise2flow/).
